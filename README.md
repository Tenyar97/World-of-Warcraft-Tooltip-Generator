You can select from a variety of spell icons (Over 23,000 found from https://github.com/Gethe/wow-ui-textures), input a unique spell name, and specify parameters such as resource cost, type, cast time, cooldown, and rank level. Additionally, the program allows for the setting of range and a comprehensive description of the spell's effects and characteristics. There are also options to denote whether a spell is a talent, class requirements, or level requirement. Whenever finished you can save completed tooltips directly as PNG files.

There are a few settings that will allow setting a default save path, and a limit of 'remembered' icons that can be reselected instead of searching through the entire list again.
